This is how to format data in the csw.txt file to create channel specific watchword sets and perform actions on the messages that contain those messages.
Watchword list supports RegEx

The Higher in the file, the greater priority the match. If a message is deleted, all other commands in lower priority will not be executed.

Channel Specific data should be of the following format:
Channel ID (if multiple, seperate with ||) =|= flags =|= Watchword list (seperated by ||) =|= Message (Optional)
Example:
646049007998730290=|=dr=|=test||bauble=|=This is a test!

Flags:
d - Delete the message. This will automatically create a Removal Report in the log channel
r - Reply to the message with the optional message
l - Log the message in the log channel
c - Log the message in the Command Channel
t - Log the message in the channel DM reports are sent to
